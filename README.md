The Low Cost Torsional Machine will produce efficient and accurate results for testing the shear modulus and other material properties under torsion. The GUI for this machine will be created using Python. The system will:
- Allow connection to the Arduino Uno via serial communication.
- Allow control of variables such as angle of twist and speed of rotation.
- Save test results to a permanent file stored on the user's device. 

The system is expected to operate:
- Hardware Platform: Desktops or Laptops
- Operating System: Windows 10 (64-bit) or above
